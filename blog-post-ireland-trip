<h2> Going to Ireland with Charlie </h2>

<p> “I want to take a trip to Ireland with you”. So says Charlie, my English girlfriend. It being March, I’d rather take off for somewhere with sunshine. London has been sodden of late. I don’t suppose Ireland is faring much better. But she insists. Ireland it is. 

She asks where we should go. I don’t really know where tourists go in Ireland. But Dublin is a no-go for me. Bellicose seagulls and junkies stalking the quays. Not for me. 

Best to get a car at the airport and make for the countryside. My parents have been renting a house near a town called Clifden in Connemara every summer since before I was born. So, I suggest a town called Clifden in Connemara. It fits the bill: Charlie wants to see stone walls aplenty. Apparently stone walls are the very essence of Irishness. Fine. Plenty of stone walls west of the Shannon. 

We touch down, hit the road, and west of the Shannon we go. The sat nav falters a bit but hey, all rain clouds lead to Galway, so we follow those when in doubt. 

We are staying in Clifden. I have suggested we get a swim in, drive the Sky Road, wander around Kylemore Abbey, and maybe visit the bog site where Alcock and Brown completed the first transatlantic flight. 

These activities hinge on a little respite from the rain. No dice. It rains continuously for 48 hours. But that’s Galway. So, we go about these things anyway, and in fairness they are only slightly less enjoyable. There’s no doubt: The place is beautiful, and beauty makes itself known, even when the weather is shit. 

Then there’s the cosy moments indoors: O’Dowd’s by the pier in Rounstone for a lunchtime chowder, dinners in Foyles Hotel and Guy’s Pub, trad and Six Nations rugby at King’s. 

We barely bicker, dry off on the drive back to the airport, and declare the trip a success.
