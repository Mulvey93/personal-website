<h1>Education + Work</h1>
<br>
<br>

<h3> 2012 - 16 (Dublin, Ireland) </h3>
<p>  I went to university. I'm not sure studying business was a wise decision. 
  I wish I'd chosen a more rigorous subject. 
  But it's done and they have my money, and I made some nice friends, so on we go :) 
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3> 2016 - 17 (New York, USA) </h3>
  After university I learnt about a graduate program available to Irish kids where you go to America for a year and intern in your field of study.
  So, I went to New York for most of 2017. Through a well connected family friend I landed a job with a small angel investment group.
  Since it was effectively a startup, I did whatever needed doing. Sometimes it was buying cheese and wine for investor social events.
  I learnt it is best to serve expensive wine first. When people get too tipsy to notice you can switch to the cheap stuff.
  Once we went downtown to Goldman Sachs to present a deck I created. I recall being very exicted to see the inside of a Wall Street bank. 
  Probably this was because I had seen The Wolf of Wall Street and wondered if I'd catch any debauchery. Sadly, no.
  <br>
  <br>
  One memorable day a production company sharing our office borrowed me to be a props boy on the set of a Scarlett Johansson movie.
  So I spent 3 hours handing her props including a feather boa and a glass of champagne. She was very bored.
  I had hoped she would notice my Irish accent and be immediately charmed. Wasn't to be. We haven't kept in touch.
  Anyway, the most important thing is the managing partners were willing mentors. My internship was effectively a very practical MBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3> 2018 - 23 (London, UK) </h3>
  Then I moved to London. My first job was with a very badly run healthcare startup. 
  I learned how not to run a company. And I learned how some good people comport themselves in difficult working circumstances.
  These were useful lessons. I can't say I would advise anyone to work at a crap company. I'm just saying it isn't a total loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then I was recruited by a research institute in Chelsea. The main goal was to help market what we were doing to big pharma
  so they would give us money to do more.
  I would say the high point was attending a conference in Paris.
  Little old me. Travelling for work. To Paris!
  I spoke to many lumanaries in the field of cardiology about thrombosis and such things, about which I know precisely nothing.
  I got comfortable with being ignorant and asking questions. Hopefully I still am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyway, time moved on. In early 2020 a Chinese colleague returned from a visit home. Apparently this COVID thing we'd heard about was no joke.
  Lockdowns ensued. Work went remote. We became involved in a COVID study with Sanofi. But mostly things were quiet.
  I wasn't learning very much and I sought to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americans came calling. I had an opportunity to rejoin that little angel group which was now a rather large VC.
  I took it, and remain an associate there to this day. I occasionally get messages from people on LinkedIn trying to "break into VC"
  (that's the phrase they always use). Each time I have to tell them I have no idea how to break into VC. I fell in. Anyway.
  The work mostly involves speaking to founders, perusing their decks/other documents, and writing deal memos. And that's where you can find me today. 
 <br>
 <br>
  <h3> Looking ahead... </h3>
  I suspect I won't be working at this VC stuff forever. I have a couple of different ideas. One is to go back to school and study something hard.
  Probably Civil Engineering. Just to stretch myself mentally. And maybe I could work in it and help build something great like a football
  stadium or a grand skyscaper. 
 <br>
 <br>
  Another idea is to create a business of my own. Frankly, I have no idea what this would look like. It would not
  necessarily be high tech. As I often say, it might not be anything more disruptive than a comfortable neighbourhood coffee shop.
  I think the appeal is in building something useful. It need not be particularly glamorous or (to use a dreadful VC-ism) scalable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly these are quite divergent paths but maybe I'll get to both of them in time. Let's see what happens :)
