<h1>Education + Work</h1>
<br>
<br>

<h3> 2012 - 16 (Dublin, Ireland) </h3>
<p>  I went to university. I coasted through my undergrad without learning much. Then I did a masters in business and marketing.
  I'm not sure studying business was a wise decision. 
  I wish I'd chosen a more rigorous subject. 
  But it's done now. They have my money, and I made some nice friends, so on we go :) 
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3> 2016 - 17 (New York, USA) </h3>
  After university I learnt about a graduate program available to Irish kids where you go to America for a year and intern in your field of study.
  So, I went to New York for most of 2017. Through a well connected family friend I landed a job with a small angel investment group.
  Since it was effectively a startup, I did whatever needed doing. Sometimes it was buying cheese and wine for investor social events.
  I learnt it is best to serve expensive wine first. When people get too tipsy to notice you can switch to the cheap stuff.
  Once we went downtown to Goldman Sachs to pitch something. I recall being very excited to see the inside of a Wall Street bank. 
  Probably this was because I had seen The Wolf of Wall Street and wondered if I'd catch any debauchery. Sadly, no.
  <br>
  <br>
  One memorable day a production company sharing our office borrowed me to be a props boy on the set of a Scarlett Johansson movie.
  So I spent 3 hours handing her props including a feather boa and a glass of champagne. She was very bored.
  I had hoped she would notice my Irish accent and be immediately charmed. Wasn't to be. We haven't kept in touch.
  Anyway, the most important thing is the managing partners were willing mentors. My internship was effectively a very practical MBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3> 2018 - 23 (London, UK) </h3>
  Then I moved to London. My first job was with a very badly run healthcare startup. 
  I learned how not to run a company. And I learned how some good people comport themselves in difficult working circumstances.
  These were useful lessons. I can't say I would advise anyone to work at a crap company. I'm just saying it isn't a total loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then I was recruited by a research institute in Chelsea. The main goal was to help market what we were doing to big pharma
  so they would give us money to do more.
  I would say the high point was attending a conference in Paris. I travelled  on the Eurostar. The Eurostar is a train that goes from London to the coast,
  crosses the Channel via an underwater tunnel, emerges in France, and rolls into Paris. I can't  comprehend that. It sounds made up to me. Anyway. 
  In Paris I spoke to many luminaries in the field of cardiology about thrombosis and such, about which I know precisely nothing.
  I got comfortable with being ignorant and asking questions. Hopefully I still am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyway, time moved on. In early 2020 a Chinese colleague returned from a visit home. Apparently this COVID thing we'd heard about was no joke.
  Lockdowns ensued. Work went remote. We became involved in a COVID study with Sanofi. My main contribution was to create a website and a portal for researchers.
  But mostly things were quiet. The study flagged.  
  I wasn't learning very much and I sought to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americans came calling. I had an opportunity to rejoin that little angel group which was now a rather large VC.
  I took it, and remain an associate there to this day. I occasionally get messages from people on LinkedIn trying to "break into VC"
  (that's the phrase they always use). Each time I have to tell them I have no idea how to break into VC. I fell in. Anyway.
  The work mostly involves speaking to founders, looking through their decks/other documents, and writing deal memos.
 <br>
 <br>
  <h3> Looking ahead... </h3>
  I suspect I won't be working at this VC stuff forever. I have a couple of different ideas. One is to go back to school and study something hard.
  Possibly Civil Engineering. Just to stretch myself mentally. And maybe I could work in it and help build something beautiful and imperious like a football
  stadium or a skyscaper. 
 <br>
 <br>
  I've been working on a business of my own. Nothing high tech. 
  I sell healthy, high protein smoothies at local sports meets (park runs, tag rugby tournaments etc.). 
  I think the appeal is in building something useful that's mine. It need not be particularly glamorous or (to use a dreadful VC-ism) scalable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly these are quite divergent paths but maybe I'll get to both of them in time. Let's see what happens :)
