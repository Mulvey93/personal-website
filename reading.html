<h1>Reading + Recommended Books</h1>
<br>
<br>

<h3> On "great" books... </h3>
<p>  I love to read. But it’s hard to find great books. There’s a lot of bad ones out there. And more bad ones are published every year.  
  <br>
 <p>  But there is no need to tolerate a bad book: There are more great books to read than you have time to read them. 
 Moreover, there are more great books worth reading that are also enjoyable to read than you have time to read them. 
 So I’m always seeking out books that belong to that subset.   
  <br>
  <p>  My primary book source is my dad. He has been reading for decades. 
  So when he tells me such and such book he read in 1981 is still with him and worth reading, I listen. 
  If you know an older person who reads a lot, I recommend asking them for their all timers.    
  <br>
   <p>  I thought I would list some of my favorites here with some thoughts on why they resonated with me. 
   If you like the sound of any of them, I recommend buying second hand copies online. 
   The savings are huge. Second hand books on Amazon usually come to ~£3.80, including postage. 
   If you dislike Amazon, World of Books might be worth a look.     
  <br>
     <p>  I would like it if there was a local bookshop I could support. But there’s only chains near me. 
     I find them hard going. They display so much newly published trash up front - people trying to upset you 
     and sell you their politics, vacuous celebrity memoirs, bad fiction… I stay away.      
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3> Anyway, the books... </h3>
<p>  52 PickUp - Elmore Leonard <br>
Really slick, down-and-dirty tale of extortion set in Baltimore. 
I don’t know of anyone who writes scumbags like Leonard. The dialogue in particular is terrific.
