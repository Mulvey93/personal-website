<h1>Reading + Recommended Books</h1>
<br>
<br>

<h3> On "great" books... </h3>
<p>  I love to read. But it’s hard to find great books. There’s a lot of bad ones out there. And more bad ones are published every year.  
  <br>
 <p>  But there is no need to tolerate a bad book: There are more great books to read than you have time to read them. 
 Moreover, there are more great books worth reading that are also enjoyable to read than you have time to read them. 
 So I’m always seeking out books that belong to that subset.   
  <br>
  <p>  My primary book source is my dad. He has been reading for decades. 
  So when he tells me such and such book he read in 1981 is still with him and worth reading, I listen. 
  If you know an older person who reads a lot, I recommend asking them for their all timers.    
  <br>
   <p>  I thought I would list some of my favorites here with some thoughts on why they resonated with me. 
   If you like the sound of any of them, I recommend buying second hand copies online. 
   The savings are huge. Second hand books on Amazon usually come to ~£3.80, including postage. 
   If you dislike Amazon, World of Books might be worth a look.     
  <br>
     <p>  I would like it if there was a local bookshop I could support. But there’s only chains near me. 
     I find them hard going. They display so much newly published trash up front - people trying to upset you 
     and sell you their politics, vacuous celebrity memoirs, bad fiction… I stay away.      
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3> Anyway, the books... </h3>
<p>  52 PickUp - Elmore Leonard <br>
Really slick, down-and-dirty tale of extortion set in Baltimore. 
I don’t know of anyone who writes scumbags like Leonard. The dialogue in particular is terrific. 
  <br>
<p>  Anything You Want - Derek Sivers <br>
Derek Sivers scaled and sold a company called CD Baby. This book recounts lessons learned along the way. 
  He points out that your company doesn’t have to follow any particular path. 
  For example, it is fine to ignore the venture capitalist’s plea to take their money and get big. 
  Your business can stay small. Maybe that would be better. In short, it can be anything you want.
 <br>
  <p>  Mila 18 - Leon Uris <br>
Set in the Warsaw Ghetto during WW2. A story about human resilience and love and dignity. 
One of the most moving books I have ever read. 
 <br>
 <p>  The Talented Mr Ripley - Patricia Highsmith <br>
I have never rooted so hard for a villain. 
 <br>
<p>  Down Under - Bill Bryson <br>
I think if Bill Bryson travelled to a carpark and wrote about it I would be compelled to visit. 
  Here he travels down under. Australia is a little thought about or discussed place, at least in the western news media. 
  After all, it is very far away, their time zone is way of of sync, and there are no bloody uprisings to speak of. 
  But in reality, there’s plenty going on there. 
  Expect to learn about the strange drowning of PM Harold Holt in the 60s, the wallop of a sting from a box jellyfish, 
  the icomrehesible scale of the outback, and its really strange founding story.  
 <br>
<p>  Bonfire of the Vanities - Tom Wolfe <br>
Really fun send up of Wall Street WASP culture, but there’s also a profound father-son passage that forms the basis for what I think being an adult is.
