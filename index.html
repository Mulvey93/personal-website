<h1>Stephen Mulvey's Personal Website</h1>

<h2> Welcome! </h2>

<p> I decided I would like to have a personal site, coded from scratch. <br>
That's why it looks the way it does :) <br>
<br>
It serves as an independent place to write/display/link to whatever I want. <br>
I suppose I am also inadvertently learning to code a bit...and I do mean a bit. <br>

<h2> A brief bio </h2> 
<p>I was born in Dublin, Ireland. I live in London these days.<br>
I work for a venture capital firm, helping to research prospective investments. <br>
My other interests are music making from my room, gym going, and tag rugby. <br>
If you would like to say hello, <a href=mailto:stephenmulvey1@gmail.com>email me.</a><br>

<h2> Useful links </h2> 
<p>Professional CV/resume: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenmulvey/">You can find my LinkedIn here.</a><br>
<p> I create music in my bedroom sometimes (original songs and covers) for fun.
